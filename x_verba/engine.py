"""
X-Verba Scan Engine v0.2.0

AI-integration-centric governance analysis.

Governance gaps are only meaningful in the context of AI calls.
Non-AI code with file writes is a compiler.
AI code with ungated file writes is a Knight Capital.

Four passes:
  1. Primitive Detection — find AI calls (AST for Python, regex for JS/TS)
  2. DC Pattern Matching — map to Drift Class taxonomy
  3. Gap Analysis — Pre-Node, Human Gate, Invariant, Terminal State gaps
  4. Structural Gamma — governed / total decision points

Context profiles:
  ai-app        — full governance analysis, irreversible actions only when AI-adjacent (default)
  system-utility — suppresses IA-GAPs for local file ops in non-AI files
  general       — scan all files, legacy v0.1 behaviour

v0.2.0 changes:
  - Irreversible actions flagged only when AI-adjacent (fixes TypeScript false positive problem)
  - Context profile support via --context-profile flag
  - Fixed Gamma calculation (was always 0 for irreversible actions)
  - Robust error handling throughout (no more crash on malformed files)
  - ai_only mode: non-AI files skipped from governance analysis

# Agent-action frameworks (elizaOS, Infinity, and similar frameworks built
# on the same convention) gate execution behind a validate(runtime, message, state)
# function — if it returns true, the action fires. "Governance theatre" is
# when that function structurally cannot check anything (no parameters, or
# every parameter underscored — TypeScript's "intentionally unused" marker)
# yet still returns true unconditionally. The gate exists; it enforces
# nothing.
#
# Scoped deliberately to only the cases that are a structural FACT, not a
# judgment call: a function with no parameter access cannot possibly check
# identity, authorisation, or message content, regardless of what's in its
# body. Config-only checks, keyword-only checks, and "is the gate sufficient
# for this action's risk level" all require contextual judgment about what a
# specific action needs — that's a human decision, not something a
# deterministic structural scanner should assert.
# A bare-expression arrow (`=> true`, no braces) never references its
# parameters no matter what they're named — this covers the param-less form,
# the underscored form, AND named-but-unused params in one structurally
# certain pattern, since the syntactic shape itself proves the params are
# unused, regardless of naming convention.

# "return true" within 300 characters could still match. Same limitation the
