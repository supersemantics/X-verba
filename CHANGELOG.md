# Changelog

## 0.6.0

### Changed

- **`openai_agents_sdk` added to `DEFAULT_FRAMEWORK_SCOPE`.** OpenAI's own
  official agent framework (`Agent()`, `Runner.run()`, `function_tool()`,
  `handoff()` — tagged separately from plain `openai` client calls via
  `_GUARDED_PROVIDER_IMPORTS`) was previously suppressed by default,
  requiring `--all-frameworks` to see. It's still squarely "OpenAI SDK",
  the same way `langgraph` sits alongside `langchain` as its own entry
  rather than being folded in or excluded. Confirmed real-world gap before
  this fix: scanned 3 real repos built on this SDK — the official
  [openai/openai-agents-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python)
  repo itself (70 findings), plus
  [modal-labs/openai-agents-python-example](https://github.com/modal-labs/openai-agents-python-example)
  (42) and
  [temporal-community/openai-agents-demos](https://github.com/temporal-community/openai-agents-demos)
  (37) — every single one of those 149 findings was invisible by default;
  the latter two repos showed only 1 generic finding each despite being
  built entirely around this SDK.

- **Regenerated the stale `evidence/langchain/langgraph/` fixture** (last
  generated 2026-06-27, predating every fix in this release) against the
  official `langchain-ai/langgraph` repo with the current engine, so the
  checked-in evidence reflects actual current tool behavior rather than a
  pre-fix snapshot.

### Fixed (real-world validation)

- **`create_swarm`/`create_handoff_tool` (the official
  [langchain-ai/langgraph-swarm-py](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-swarm-py)
  package's top-level API) were completely unrecognised.** Same class of
  gap as `create_react_agent`: the package's own documented usage example
  — a downstream caller building a swarm of agents with handoff tools,
  never touching `StateGraph`/`add_node` directly — produced zero
  langgraph findings before this fix, despite genuinely using LangGraph's
  official swarm library end to end. Added both as new unconditional
  entries (distinctive compound names, no corroboration needed).

- **`create_react_agent` (`langgraph.prebuilt`), LangGraph's high-level
  "quick start" agent factory, was completely unrecognised.**
  `AGENT_FRAMEWORK_PATTERNS["langgraph"]` only had the low-level
  `StateGraph`/`add_node`/`add_edge` graph-building API — a repo using only
  the prebuilt API had zero langgraph findings despite real, working
  LangGraph usage throughout. Found scanning a real public repo
  ([braincrew-lab/langgraph-mcp-agents](https://github.com/braincrew-lab/langgraph-mcp-agents)),
  which uses only `create_react_agent` and never touches `StateGraph`
  directly — a repo named "langgraph-mcp-agents" showed 0 langgraph
  decision points before this fix. Added `create_react_agent` as a new,
  unconditional (no corroboration needed — distinctive compound name)
  entry.

### Fixed

- **`x-verba qa` and `scan --compare` wrote their verification report to a
  path relative to the process's own working directory, not the scanned
  repo.** `OutputWriter.write_verification()`'s bare default
  (`.verba/governance-verification.{ext}`) is a relative path — unlike
  `scan`'s main report/contract and `--save-baseline` (both correctly
  anchored via `Path(path) / ".verba"` / `BaselineStore`), so running `qa`
  or `scan --compare` from inside a different directory than the target
  repo silently wrote output there instead. Concretely: every `pytest`
  run from this repo's own root was leaving a stray `.verba/` in the
  X-Verba repo itself (harmless — already gitignored — but real clutter,
  found while scanning an external public repo and noticing an
  unrelated `.verba/` folder sitting in the wrong place). Both commands
  now explicitly anchor to `Path(path) / ".verba"`, matching the pattern
  `scan` already used.

### Fixed (real-world validation)

- **LangChain.js's `initChatModel` (the "universal model loader",
  `langchain/chat_models/universal`) was completely undetected.** Found by
  scanning a real production LangGraph.js repo
  ([mayooear/ai-pdf-chatbot-langchain](https://github.com/mayooear/ai-pdf-chatbot-langchain))
  — it routes every LLM call through this function, which dynamically
  instantiates whichever provider is named at runtime, so there's no `new
  ChatOpenAI(...)`-style call site to match. The repo's `ai_integrations`
  count was 0 despite making real LLM calls throughout (LangGraph
  detection itself was unaffected and correctly found all 13 handover/
  decision-point findings, including the fluent method-chained
  `.addNode()`/`.addEdge()` style — only the LLM-call side was blind).
  Added `initChatModel(` to `JS_AI_PATTERNS`. Python's equivalent
  (`init_chat_model`, `langchain.chat_models.init_chat_model`) was already
  correctly detected via the existing import-tracking mechanism — no fix
  needed there, confirmed by direct test.

### Added

- **`--all-frameworks` scan flag** (`ScanEngine(all_frameworks=...)` /
  `x-verba scan --all-frameworks`). Default scope narrows AI-provider and
  agent-invocation-decision-point detection to `DEFAULT_FRAMEWORK_SCOPE`
  (OpenAI, LangChain, LangGraph — the three frameworks precision-audited
  below), suppressing CrewAI/AutoGen/Google/AWS Bedrock/etc. findings from
  the default report rather than deleting their detectors. Pass the flag
  to widen back to everything the engine recognises. Deliberately does
  **not** scope `agent_handovers` — that subsystem's 9 detection families
  are structural-pattern-based, not framework-tagged per finding (its
  graph/builder-edge family alone covers LangGraph, Microsoft Agent
  Framework, AutoGen, and Haystack with one shared detector and no
  per-finding framework label), so it stays framework-agnostic/always-on
  regardless of this flag.
- **`x-verba qa` also gained `--all-frameworks`.** It was previously
  hard-coded to `ScanEngine()`'s default scope with no way to widen it,
  despite its own docstring calling itself "equivalent to `scan --compare`".
  Both `qa` and `scan --compare` now warn if the loaded baseline's
  `all_frameworks` setting doesn't match the current run's — a scope
  mismatch otherwise surfaces as false framework-related
  regressions/improvements in `ai_providers`/`agent_inventory` deltas that
  are really just "the current scan can no longer see what the baseline
  saw" rather than an actual code change.
- **Governance contract/report output (`writer.py`) now records framework
  scope** alongside the existing context-profile line, in both the YAML
  metadata block and the markdown governance-contract header — a report
  scoped to the default three frameworks now says so, rather than reading
  as if it covered everything the engine can detect.

LangChain/LangGraph/OpenAI/Anthropic detection precision pass — six
confirmed false positives fixed and one real coverage gap closed, across
both languages LangChain and LangGraph actually ship in (Python, JS/TS).
Every fix below was verified with a real before/after scan, not just
inferred from reading the code, and each now has a permanent regression
test in `TestFrameworkDetectionPrecision` (`x_verba/tests/test_matrix.py`).

### Fixed

- **Python AST decision-point matching was raw substring, not anchored.**
  `DecisionPointAnalyser._function_call` matched `AGENT_FRAMEWORK_PATTERNS`
  / `CONSEQUENCE_TYPE_PATTERNS` via `pattern in call_str` — a variable
  named `supply_chain` calling `.run_pipeline()` matched LangChain's
  `chain.run` purely by character overlap. Now uses the same
  boundary-anchored matching (`_call_matches_pattern`) the JS/TS/Go/Rust/C#
  pattern-based path already had via `_pattern_matches_call`, so the Python
  path (the one branded "full AST-based analysis") is at least as precise,
  not looser.
- **LangGraph's `add_node`/`add_edge`/`graph.invoke` collided with
  NetworkX.** Both libraries use the identical method names for their own,
  unrelated graph-building APIs. These entries now require the file to
  also show a corroborating `langgraph` import or `StateGraph` reference
  (`_AMBIGUOUS_FRAMEWORK_PATTERNS` / `_framework_corroborated`) before
  counting. `StateGraph` itself stays unconditional — a genuinely
  distinctive class name.
- **LangChain's `agent.run`/`agent.invoke`/`chain.run`/`chain.invoke`/
  `create_agent` collided with any domain "agent" or "chain" object** —
  confirmed false positive on ordinary insurance-claims code
  (`InsuranceAgent.run()`, `ApprovalChain.invoke()`). Same corroboration
  treatment: requires a real `langchain*` import or `AgentExecutor`/
  `LLMChain` elsewhere in the file.
- **LangGraph.js was almost entirely invisible.** `AGENT_FRAMEWORK_PATTERNS`
  only listed LangGraph's Python (snake_case) method names — `add_node`/
  `add_edge` — never LangGraph.js's actual (camelCase) API. A real
  LangGraph.js file scanned before this fix produced only 1 detection
  (`StateGraph`); the `.addNode()`/`.addEdge()` call sites themselves were
  never seen. Both languages' method names are now listed, and the
  corroboration regexes recognize JS/TS import syntax (`from
  "@langchain/langgraph"`, `require(...)`) alongside the Python forms.
- **The same LangChain agent/chain ambiguity existed uncorrected on the
  JS/TS side**, in two places: `JS_AI_PATTERNS`' `chain.invoke`/
  `agent.invoke` (AI-integration layer) and the shared
  `PatternDecisionPointAnalyser` used by the JS/Go/Rust/C# decision-point
  path (which had anchored matching already, but no import corroboration).
  Both now gated the same way as Python, confirmed against a plain
  TypeScript class with `.invoke()` methods and no LangChain import.
- **`messages.create`/`client.messages`/`client.chat` had no import
  corroboration at all**, unlike the rest of `AI_CALL_METHODS`'s generic
  entries. Confirmed false positive: Twilio's Python SDK
  (`client.messages.create(...)`, sending SMS) was flagged as an AI
  integration purely from the call shape. Now requires the file to
  actually import `openai`/`anthropic` (checked against
  `ASTAnalyser.ai_imports`, which is already precisely tracked) before
  these count.

## 0.5.0

Multi-agent handover detection — the full body of work. `agent_inventory`
(Agents Detected / Handovers / Chains / Clusters) went from reporting 0 on
every real multi-agent repo tested, to correctly detecting all 8 confirmed
handover families across 30+ real frameworks. Bundled with this release:
the systemic AI-provider-import-gap fix (9-for-9), 4 file-walker bugs, and
raw-HTTP AI-provider-call detection. See the entries below for the full,
chronological breakdown of everything that shipped on the way here.

Family 3 (recursive self-delegation) gets its first JS/TS implementation —
found while resolving the correct GitHub URL for OpenClaw, which let us
verify its own source directly for the first time (previously, OpenClaw's
placement in this family rested on Hermes's docstring *citing* OpenClaw as
inspiration, not on scanning OpenClaw's own code).

### Added

- **`AgentHandoverAnalyser.analyse_js()` now detects family 3.** A call to
  `spawnSubagentDirect(...)` (or a reasonable variant name), corroborated
  by a depth-tracking identifier (`spawnDepth`/`childDepth`/`maxDepth`)
  present somewhere in the file — the JS/TS equivalent of the existing
  Python detector, same two-signal requirement. Confirmed against
  OpenClaw's own `src/agents/subagent-spawn.ts`/`subagent-depth.ts`. Most
  real matches are the function calling itself (`spawnSubagentDirect ->
  <delegated subagent>`), which is the literal, correct representation of
  recursive self-delegation. Re-scan after fix, OpenClaw's own
  `src/agents`: 0 → 2 agents / 1 handover.

No regressions across a 3-repo JS/TS sweep.

---

Family 8 (pub/sub messaging) extended with a 3rd, fully independent
confirmation, and a new family-1 (graph/builder) variant added —
following up on third-party feedback on the framework taxonomy that
prompted re-checking AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, and MCP.

### Added

- **AutoGen's own core runtime pub/sub pair** — `publish_message()` (the
  exact same method name as MetaGPT's) paired with
  `add_subscription(Subscription)`, confirmed in `autogen-core`'s own
  source (`_agent_runtime.py`, `_subscription.py`,
  `_single_threaded_agent_runtime.py`). Re-scan after fix: 0 → 2 agents /
  1 handover on AutoGen's own core runtime.
- **Semantic Kernel's Process Framework edge-builder** —
  `step.on_event("EventName").send_event_to(target=other_step, ...)`
  (also `on_input_event`/`on_function_result` as trigger methods). Looked
  like a family-8 (pub/sub) candidate going in — "event" terminology
  suggested a broadcast — but the actual shape is a *declared* edge
  between two specific steps, not a decoupled broadcast to an unknown set
  of subscribers, so it's family 1, not family 8. `target=` is a keyword
  argument, not positional — confirmed against real source
  (`samples/concepts/processes/plan_and_execute.py`) before implementing.
  Re-scan after fix: 0 → 16 agents / 17 handovers across SK's own process
  samples.

### Considered, not added

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — has a genuine network-handshake
  shape (`ClientSession.call_tool(name, ...)`), but it's an
  **agent-to-tool** protocol, not **agent-to-agent** — its purpose is
  connecting an LLM app to external tools/resources, not handing off to
  another agent. Adding it to family 4 would blur the family's actual
  defining trait. Not implemented.

No regressions across a 6-repo sweep.

---

Family 4 (protocol/server) extended with a 3rd confirmed shape — CrewAI's
own A2A protocol implementation: `execute_a2a_delegation(endpoint=...,
agent_id=..., from_agent=..., ...)` / `aexecute_a2a_delegation(...)`, a
bare function call (not a method on a `*Client` object), naming its
target via `agent_id=` rather than `name=`. Confirmed against CrewAI's
real `a2a/utils/delegation.py`. Re-scan of CrewAI's own source
(`lib/crewai/src/crewai`): 0 → 5 agents / 4 handovers (family 2's
`agents:` field plus this new shape). No regressions.

---

Raw-HTTP AI-provider call detection. Confirmed 3 times this session (JS
`fetch()`, Python `httpx`, a 20-file hit via a custom `fetchWithCache()`
wrapper in promptfoo) that an AI API call with no SDK import and no
distinctive method name — just a known provider hostname inside a
generic HTTP call — was entirely invisible. Implemented as a per-file
fallback: only runs on a file that produced zero AI-integration findings
via every existing import/pattern detector, so it can't double-count a
file already correctly detected.

### Added

- `_detect_raw_http_ai_calls()` matches a curated set of ~13 major
  AI-provider hostnames (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Together, DeepSeek,
  Mistral, Google, Groq, Perplexity, Fireworks, OpenRouter, xAI, AWS
  Bedrock) as string literals, language-agnostic. Re-scan after fix,
  `omnigent`'s adapters (the original confirmation): 3 → 4 of `anthropic
  .py`/`openai.py`/`gemini.py`/`bedrock.py` now correctly detected (was 1
  of 4, `bedrock.py`, via `boto3`). `pydantic-ai`'s own `providers/groq.py`
  (`httpx.AsyncClient`-based) caught as a genuine, previously-undetected
  find.

### Two precision bugs caught and fixed during verification, before
### either landed

- **Bare hostname presence isn't enough.** First draft matched a known
  hostname anywhere in a file, with no requirement that the file
  actually issue an HTTP call. False positive: `ClawTeam-OpenClaw`'s
  `spawn/presets.py`, a `base_url=` preset *value* passed through to an
  externally-spawned CLI process, never itself used to make a request.
  Fixed: require an HTTP-call-shaped token (`fetch\w*(`, `requests.*(`,
  `httpx.`, `urlopen(`, `axios.`, `urllib.request`) present somewhere in
  the file — not necessarily near the URL, since the 3 confirmed real
  positives all have the URL and the eventual call in different
  functions.
- **That alone still wasn't enough.** Second false positive, same class
  one level removed: `TradingAgents`' `cli/utils.py:349-360`, a tuple
  list of provider display names/hostnames for a CLI menu — a real
  `requests.get(...)` call existed elsewhere in the same file (fetching
  OpenRouter's model list), which satisfied the verb-corroboration check
  even though the menu tuples themselves were never a call site. Fixed:
  also require exactly one *distinct* provider hostname in the whole
  file — every confirmed real positive is a file dedicated to one
  provider; a multi-provider preset list or menu is enumeration data, not
  an implementation.

### Known limitation (not fixed in this release)

- Cross-file delegation isn't traced. `promptfoo`'s `togetherai.ts` and
  `openrouter.ts` each set a provider-specific `base_url`/hostname but
  delegate the actual HTTP call to a shared `OpenAiChatCompletionProvider`
  class in a *different file* (`openai/chat.ts`) — same general
  limitation class as the interprocedural cases already documented for
  list-composition (CrewAI-Studio's `**kwargs` unpacking) and family 4.
  Of promptfoo's 20 originally-confirmed `fetchWithCache`-based provider
  files, 7 are now caught (the ones using a listed hostname directly,
  same-file); the rest either use a vendor hostname not in the curated
  list (extending the list is a one-line addition if prioritized) or
  delegate cross-file.

No regressions — AI-integration counts unchanged across a 16-repo
regression sweep (the two precision-bug repos confirmed back at their
exact baseline after each fix).

---

Multi-agent handover detection — family 8 (team registry + publish/
subscribe messaging). The first family whose handover signature spans
*multiple files* — every confirmed real example splits the publish half
and the subscribe half across separate files, so this runs as a
repo-wide pass (`_detect_pubsub_messaging`), not a per-file detector like
every other family.

### Added

- **MetaGPT (Python)** — `Environment.publish_message(message)` (a
  distribution method) paired with `Role._watch(actions)` /
  `Role.set_addresses(addresses)` (per-agent subscription filters),
  confirmed split across 3 files (`team.py`, `environment/base_env.py`,
  `roles/role.py`). Re-scan after fix: 0 → 2 agents / 1 handover.
- **open-agent-sdk-typescript (JS/TS)** — a `TeamCreateTool`/
  `SendMessageTool` tool-definition pair, identified by their literal
  `name: 'TeamCreate'`/`name: 'SendMessage'` values, confirmed split
  across 2 files (`team-tools.ts`, `send-message.ts`). Re-scan after fix:
  3 → 5 agents / 2 → 3 handovers (additive on top of family 7, already
  detected in the same repo).

No regressions — AI-integration counts unchanged across a 10-repo
regression sweep; no false positives on repos without this pattern.

---

Multi-agent handover detection — family 4 (protocol/server). The first
family with no in-process call chain at all — a client object calling a
remotely, independently-deployed agent/workflow over a network boundary.

### Added

- **AP2's `*Client(name=..., base_url=...)` shape** — any constructor
  ending in `Client` carrying both a `name=` and a `base_url=` keyword.
  Re-scan after fix, AP2's real `remote_agents.py`:
  `credentials_provider_client` → `credentials_provider`,
  `merchant_agent_client` → `merchant_agent`. Full-app re-scan: 0 → 12
  agents / 9 handovers (family 2's `sub_agents=[...]` and family 4's
  remote clients co-occurring in the same app, exactly as documented
  during evidence-gathering).
- **llama_deploy's `.run_workflow(workflow_name, ...)` shape** — a
  bespoke REST protocol, not A2A, confirming this family is a genuine
  architectural pattern independent of any specific wire protocol.

No regressions — AI-integration counts unchanged across an 11-repo
regression sweep.

---

Multi-agent handover detection — families 3 and 7 (recursive
self-delegation, and named subagent registry). Grouped together since
family 7 is family 3's static-declaration cousin: a predefined registry
of subagents vs. a dynamically depth-tracked spawn tree.

### Added

- **Family 3 — recursive self-delegation.** A tool function (literally
  named `delegate_task`/`delegate_agent`/`spawn_agent`/`spawn_subagent`)
  that recursively spawns a child instance of the same agent. Requires a
  depth-cap signal (`max_spawn_depth`/`MAX_DEPTH`/`max_depth`/
  `child_depth`) present somewhere in the file to corroborate — the depth
  cap, not the call name alone, is this family's structural signature, so
  a function that happens to share one of these names without any
  depth-tracking nearby is not matched. Re-scan after fix, Hermes's real
  `tools/delegate_tool.py`: 0 → 2 agents / 1 handover (correctly matching
  the tool's own self-referential registration,
  `handler=lambda args, **kw: delegate_task(...)`).
- **Family 7 — named subagent registry**, in both languages. Python:
  `ClaudeAgentOptions(agents={"code-reviewer": AgentDefinition(...)})` —
  a dict keyed by name, distinguished from family 2's same-named
  `agents=` keyword by value type (family 2 requires a List, this
  requires a Dict). Re-scan after fix, the real Claude Agent SDK
  `examples/agents.py`: 0 → 5 agents / 4 handovers. JS/TS: `const
  BUILTIN_AGENTS: Record<string, AgentDefinition> = { Explore: {...},
  Plan: {...} }` — uses proper brace-balance matching
  (`_js_balanced_brace_span`), not a character window, since an early
  draft of this detector spilled past the object's closing brace into
  unrelated code in the same file and produced false positives (caught
  before landing). Re-scan after fix, the real
  `open-agent-sdk-typescript/src/tools/agent-tool.ts`: 0 → 3 agents / 2
  handovers.

No regressions — AI-integration counts unchanged across a 10-repo
regression sweep spanning both languages.

---

Multi-agent handover detection — family 5 (agent-as-tool). A sub-agent
wrapped inside a tool definition, handed to a supervisor — the handover
is invisible at the supervisor's declaration site, only visible by
tracing into the tool's body. Three independent wrapping syntaxes, all
detected:

### Added

- **OpenAI Agents SDK's built-in method** — `Agent(tools=[spanish_agent
  .as_tool(tool_name=..., tool_description=...), ...])`. Re-scan after
  fix, the real `agents_as_tools.py` example: 0 → 3 agents / 3 handovers
  (`orchestrator_agent` → `spanish_agent`/`french_agent`/`italian_agent`).
- **Pydantic AI's decorator form** — `@triage_agent.tool` applied to a
  function whose body calls a *different* agent's `.run(`/`.invoke(`.
  Re-scan after fix, the real `medical_agent_delegation.py` example:
  `triage_agent` → `specialist_agent`/`senior_doctor_agent`.
- **LangChain.js's manual-wrap form, and the engine's first JS/TS
  handover detection** (previously Python-AST-only) — `const
  scheduleEvent = tool(async (...) => { await calendarAgent.invoke(...)
  }, {...})` then `createAgent({ tools: [scheduleEvent] })`. Pattern-based
  (windowed character-distance matching, not balanced-brace parsing,
  consistent with how JS/TS detection works elsewhere in this engine).
  Re-scan after fix, the real `subagents-personal-assistant.ts` example:
  0 → 2 agents / 2 handovers; a 3rd, correctly generalised find on
  `router-knowledge-base.ts` in the same directory — a compiled
  `workflow` object (not literally named "...Agent") wrapped as a tool
  the same way, picked up by the same `.invoke(` pattern match.

No regressions — AI-integration counts unchanged across the full
regression sweep (8 repos spanning both languages).

## 0.4.7

Multi-agent handover detection — family 6 (constructor-keyword handoff
list). Reuses the same AST shape as family 2's list-composition (a
constructor keyword whose value is a list) since `handoffs=` is
structurally identical, just a different semantic label — no new
detection mechanism needed, only a new keyword and one extra method for
the post-construction mutation form.

### Added

- **`Agent(handoffs=[...])`, both confirmed sub-variants.** OpenAI Agents
  SDK's wrapper-object form — `handoffs=[handoff(agent=faq_agent,
  on_handoff=..., tool_name_override=...), ...]` — and Swarms' flat-list
  form — `handoffs=[agent1, agent2]` (no wrapper call). `_literal_or_name`
  now resolves an `agent=` keyword on an inline call, recursively, to
  find the real target through the `handoff(...)` wrapper.
- **`faq_agent.handoffs.append(handoff(agent=triage_agent, ...))`** — the
  post-construction mutation form, detected as a separate pattern (an
  `.append()` call on a `.handoffs` attribute).
- Re-scan after fix, `openai-agents-python`'s real customer-service
  example: 0 → 3 agents / 4 handovers (all 4 edges of the
  triage/faq/seat-booking graph, including both directions of the
  `.handoffs.append()` mutations).

### Known limitation (not fixed in this release)

- `on_handoff=` presence/absence at a given edge is a documented
  governance-relevant signal (a real callback that runs before/during the
  handoff) but isn't yet recognised as a Pre-Node by `_assess_pre_node_strength`
  — all family 6 handovers currently report as ungoverned regardless of
  whether `on_handoff=` is present. Confirmed on the same
  `openai-agents-python` example (the `seat_booking_agent` handoff has
  `on_handoff=on_seat_booking_handoff` but still reports ungoverned).
  Scheduled as a follow-up refinement, not a detection gap.

## 0.4.6

Multi-agent handover detection — families 1 and 2. `agent_inventory`
(Agents Detected / Handovers / Chains / Clusters) reported 0 on every real
multi-agent repo scanned this session because `AgentHandoverAnalyser` only
recognised one shape (`agent_a.run(x)` -> variable -> `agent_b.run(var)`,
same function body). Real frameworks build multi-agent systems two other
ways just as commonly: declaring a graph of edges, or passing a flat list
of agents into a constructor. Both are now detected, verified empirically
by re-scanning real repos before/after.

### Added

- **Family 1 — graph/builder edges.** Detects
  `StateGraph().add_node(...).add_edge(a, b)` (LangGraph),
  `WorkflowBuilder().add_edge(a, b)` (Microsoft Agent Framework),
  `pipeline.connect(sender, receiver)` (Haystack), and `DiGraphBuilder`
  (AutoGen) — both the fluent-chained form and the assign-then-call form
  (`workflow = StateGraph(...); workflow.add_edge(a, b)`). Each `add_edge`/
  `connect` call becomes a handover edge between the two node labels.
  Re-scan after fix: `TradingAgents` (a real LangGraph trading-debate
  pipeline) 0 → 12 agents / 7 handovers / 4 chains / 5 clusters;
  `azure-trust-agents` (Microsoft Agent Framework) 0 → 4 agents / 12
  handovers.
- **Family 2 — list-composition.** Detects `agents=[...]` (CrewAI),
  `participants=[...]` (AutoGen), `sub_agents=[...]` (Google ADK),
  `members=[...]` (Semantic Kernel, OpenClaw's own team model) — any
  constructor keyword from this set whose value is a list, including one
  level of same-file variable indirection (`agent_list = [a, b];
  Crew(agents=agent_list)`). Re-scan after fix: a Google ADK sample
  (`root_agent = Agent(sub_agents=[weather_agent])`) 0 → 2 agents / 1
  handover; `ClawTeam-OpenClaw`'s own team model (`TeamConfig(members=
  [leader])`) 0 → 2 agents / 1 handover.

### Fixed — file-walker

- **`SKIP_FILENAMES` (setup.py, conftest.py, setup.cfg) matched by bare
  filename anywhere in the tree, not just at the repo root.** A module
  that happens to share one of these names deeper in the tree — e.g.
  `tradingagents/graph/setup.py`, the actual LangGraph workflow
  construction file, the single most relevant file in that repo for this
  exact feature — was being skipped as if it were build tooling. Now only
  applied to files at the scanned repo's own root.

### Known limitations (not fixed in this release)

- List-composition detection does not trace a constructor keyword's value
  through a function call — `agents, handoffs = get_agents()` followed by
  `HandoffOrchestration(members=agents, ...)` is not detected, since the
  actual list literal lives inside `get_agents()`'s return statement, one
  function away. Same limitation class as the dict-unpacking case below.
  Confirmed on Semantic Kernel's own `step4_handoff.py` example.
- Constructor keywords built via `**kwargs` dict-unpacking are not
  detected — `Crew(*args, **crew_params)` where `crew_params["agents"]`
  is assigned earlier gives no literal `agents=` keyword in the AST for
  this detector to see. Confirmed on `CrewAI-Studio`'s real `my_crew.py`.
  Both of these would need interprocedural/dataflow tracing, a
  meaningfully larger feature than this release's scope.
- JS/TS support, family 1's `add_conditional_edges` variant and Mastra's
  `.step()`/`.then()` chain form, families 3-9, and the IaC-declared
  variant (AWS Bedrock Agents' `agent_collaborators=` in a CDK stack) are
  not yet implemented — scheduled for follow-up releases per the
  implementation order in `.claude/skills/agent-handover-detection`.

## 0.4.5

File-walker fixes. All four were found by reading `_collect_files()` and
its supporting constants against real repos, then verified empirically by
re-scanning before/after each change.

### Fixed

- **`.test-d.ts` (vitest/tsd type-testing convention) wasn't recognised as
  a test file.** `TEST_FILE_RE` required a literal `.` immediately after
  `test`/`spec`, so `.test.ts` matched but `.test-d.ts` (hyphen instead of
  dot) did not. On a real scan (`vercel/ai`), **126 of 128 candidate
  governance nodes (98.4%) traced back to a single type-test file** with
  no real application logic — the scan's entire headline result (128
  critical findings, Gamma 0.08) was almost completely noise from this one
  misclassification. Likely the highest-impact single bug fixed across
  this round of work.
- **`--focus` resolved relative paths against the CLI process's working
  directory, not the scanned repository.** `--focus packages/core/src`
  silently returned 0 files scanned unless run from inside the target
  repo. Now resolved relative to the repo path being scanned.
- **`SKIP_DIRS` pruned directories named `examples`/`samples`/`docs`/etc.
  even when an explicit `--focus` target lived inside one of them** —
  `--focus examples/src/multi-agent` returned 0 files even with the path
  bug above fixed, because the walker pruned `examples/` before the focus
  filter ever ran. Now a normally-skipped directory is still walked into
  if it's required to reach an explicit focus target (the target itself,
  or one of its ancestors); once inside the focus subtree, normal
  skip-dir rules resume as expected. Re-scan after both `--focus` fixes
  (`langchainjs`, `--focus examples/src/multi-agent`): 0 → 5 files.
- **No exclusion for minified/bundled JS shipped inside a source tree.**
  A CLI tool's own bundled web UI (a 4,210-line minified Angular build
  artifact) was scanned as real source and showed up in the scan's top
  influential decisions by PageRank — pure noise from a vendored,
  built artifact. Added a filename heuristic for `*.min.js` and
  webpack/esbuild-style content-hashed chunk filenames
  (`main-3CUQG2IN.js`, `chunk-NALL4A3P.js`). Confirmed via re-scan
  (`google/adk-python`): the bundle no longer appears anywhere in the
  contract.

## 0.4.4

### Added — governance theatre detection

- New detector for a specific TS/JS anti-pattern: an agent-action
  framework's `validate()` function that unconditionally returns `true`
  regardless of its input (a bare `=> true` arrow, or a body whose
  parameters are all underscore-prefixed/unused) — present and callable,
  but never actually checking anything. Scoped to require a corroborating
  agent-action-framework signal (`handler:`, `iagentruntime`,
  `@elizaos/core`, `similes:`) in the same file, so it doesn't fire on
  unrelated `validate()` functions elsewhere in a codebase. Confirmed on
  elizaOS-pattern plugins (49 findings on a real plugin set during
  development); 0 false positives confirmed on every non-agent-framework
  TS/JS repo scanned this session.

### AI-provider detection

AI-provider detection release. Scanned 35+ real repositories across every
major current agent framework/SDK (LangChain v1, OpenAI Agents SDK, Google
ADK, Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK in both Python and JS/TS, AWS Strands,
AWS's JS Bedrock SDK, LlamaIndex's agent/workflow submodule, Agency Swarm)
and found the same class of bug nine times: each framework's own current
top-level import was simply absent from the provider-detection tables,
causing affected scans to report **zero AI integrations** — not a missing
inventory section, the entire scan finding nothing to evaluate. Every fix
below was verified empirically by re-scanning the real repository
before/after the change.

### Fixed — AI-provider import detection (9 confirmed gaps)

- **Modern LangChain (v1.x)** — `langchain.chat_models` (the new
  provider-agnostic `init_chat_model` factory) and `langchain.agents` (the
  new unified `create_agent` constructor) were missing; only the legacy
  `langchain_openai`/`AgentExecutor` surface was recognised. Confirmed
  100% false negative on `chat-langchain`, a real production RAG agent.
  Re-scan after fix: 0 → 7 AI integrations.
- **OpenAI Agents SDK** — its package is literally named `agents`, too
  generic to safelist outright (would false-positive on any unrelated
  local module of the same name). Added as a *guarded* import: only
  recognised when the file also contains `Agent(`, `Runner.run(`, or
  `handoff(` — the same precaution already used for generic method names.
  Re-scan after fix: 0 → 8 AI integrations.
- **Google ADK and the newer `google.genai` SDK** — distinct from
  `google.generativeai`, which was already recognised. Confirmed on a
  real multi-agent payments app (Google's AP2). Re-scan after fix
  (bypassing an unrelated pre-existing `SKIP_DIRS` bug that excludes any
  `samples/` directory — see Known Issues): 0 → 15 AI integrations.
- **Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK — Python and JS/TS, two separate fixes.**
  The Python package is `claude_agent_sdk`; the JS/TS package is the
  differently-named `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`. Both were missing —
  fixing one does not fix the other, even for the same vendor's own SDK.
  Re-scan after fix: SDK examples 0 → 102; a real desktop app built on the
  JS/TS package, 0 → 6.
- **AWS Strands Agents** (`strands` package) — distinct from
  `bedrock_agentcore` (a separate AWS runtime/deployment SDK, already
  recognised via `boto3`). Confirmed on a real Bedrock chat app where the
  actual agent-construction file was invisible despite the app's overall
  AI-integration count looking nonzero (from unrelated `boto3` calls
  elsewhere) — a reminder that a nonzero count can still hide a 100% miss
  on the framework that actually matters. Re-scan after fix: the specific
  file now appears in the contract.
- **AWS SDK for JavaScript v3's Bedrock clients** — distinct from Python's
  `boto3`, already recognised. Confirmed on a real, fully-functional
  Electron desktop app. Re-scan after fix: 0 → 34 AI integrations.
- **LlamaIndex's agent/workflow submodule** — `llama_index.llms` was
  already recognised, but `llama_index.core.agent`/`llama_index.core.workflow`
  were not; import matching is by full dotted path, not top-level package,
  so partial recognition of one submodule doesn't extend to another.
  Re-scan after fix: 1 → 61 AI integrations.
- **Agency Swarm** (`agency_swarm` package) — confirmed on a real
  multi-agent assistant app. Re-scan after fix: 15 → 90 AI integrations.

### Known issues (not fixed in this release)

- `SKIP_DIRS` unconditionally excludes `examples/` and `samples/` (among
  others), even when those directories contain the only relevant source
  in a repo, and even when explicitly passed via `--focus`. Confirmed on
  `langchainjs` and `google-agentic-commerce/AP2`. Scheduled for a
  follow-up release alongside the other file-walker bugs (`--focus`
  cwd-resolution, no minified-bundle exclusion, `.test-d.ts` not matching
  the test-file regex).
- Raw-HTTP AI-provider calls (no SDK import, no distinctive method name —
  just a provider hostname inside a generic `fetch`/`httpx`/custom-wrapper
  call) remain undetected. Confirmed on 3 independent codebases, including
  20 provider files in a single repo (`promptfoo`). Needs a different
  detection strategy (hostname/path matching) and is scheduled separately.
- Multi-agent handover detection (`agent_inventory` reporting 0 agents/
  handovers on real multi-agent repos) is a separate, larger body of work
  — 9 confirmed handover shapes across the frameworks above, not yet
  implemented.

## 0.4.3

Detection-accuracy release. Every fix below was found by reading the engine
source against an independent audit, then verified empirically by re-scanning
real repositories (`gogcli`, `ECC`, `minGPT`, a Gemini/LangGraph quickstart)
before and after each change — not just patched and assumed correct.

### Fixed — false positives

- **`has_recovery` counted logging-only exception handlers as real recovery.**
  `except Exception as e: logger.error(e)` was reported as a genuine recovery
  path in Python, JS/TS, *and* Go (a third instance neither source audit
  caught) — meaning errors that were actually swallowed silently still
  counted as "handled." Terminal-state counts dropped 92-100% on real repos
  after this fix alone.
- **Terminal-state detection fired on files with no AI integration at all.**
  A pure utility file's exception handling was flagged the same as AI-adjacent
  code. Now scoped to AI-adjacent files only, matching the same rule already
  used for irreversible-action detection.
- **`subprocess.run`/`subprocess.call` were flagged as critical regardless of
  the actual command** — `git fetch`, `pytest`, `uv run test` were treated
  identically to `rm -rf`. Fixed to check command content — and a second bug
  was found and fixed in the same pass: the original proposed fix (and our
  first implementation of it) only matched shell-string-style commands
  (`"rm -rf /path"`), silently missing the more common Python list-style
  calls (`["rm", "-rf", "/path"]`) — which would have traded a false positive
  for a false negative on the exact case it was meant to catch.
- **`_has_dynamic_prompt()` and `_identify_provider()` flagged unrelated
  code as AI/prompt issues.** A 20-line window checked for any keyword or
  template signal anywhere in the block, with no requirement that they
  co-occur — a variable named `query_domains` 15 lines from an unrelated
  f-string could trigger a false AI-lifecycle finding. Also, generic method
  names (`.chat(`, `.query(`, `.predict(`) were matched as AI calls on *any*
  object, not just recognized AI clients — a `db.query()` call could be
  misidentified as an AI integration. Both fixed: the window now requires a
  prompt keyword and a template signal on the *same* line, and generic method
  names require a recognized AI import as the call's root object.

### Fixed — scoring accuracy

- **Gamma's denominator included every decision point detected, not just
  consequential ones** — null checks, simple loops, and ternaries with no
  downstream consequence inflated the count (and therefore the apparent
  precision) of the score. Now filtered to decision points that actually
  lead to a consequence, in both `GammaVariantsBuilder` and the sibling
  `GovernanceMetricsBuilder.compute_coverage()` (a second instance of the
  same bug, not previously identified). This changes the displayed Gamma
  value on existing scans — sometimes up, sometimes down, depending on
  whether a repo's apparent governance was concentrated in real enforcement
  or in the null-check noise being removed.
- **The Pre-Node "governed" threshold (0.5) let a guard with no hard block
  count as governed** — `if result: db.commit()` passed with no `raise` or
  `return` anywhere in the guard body, purely from scope overlap. Raised to
  0.7, and consolidated four separate hardcoded `0.5` literals (which would
  have drifted out of sync with each other) into one shared constant.
- **Gamma was displayed with up to 17 digits of floating-point noise**
  (`0.10540059347181009`) in the terminal, JSON, and YAML output. Now
  rounded to 2 decimal places at the single source all three formats read
  from, plus a separate stray `.4f` (4 decimals) in the terminal printer
  that would have stayed wrong even after the source-level fix.

### Fixed — Drift Class labeling

- **Two of the engine's highest-confidence, most-frequently-triggered DC
  labels didn't match their own canonical definitions.** "Unsanitized user
  input into an AI prompt" was labeled `DC-E5` (Dominance Forcing — coercive
  rhetorical structure, an unrelated phenomenon); corrected to `DC-E3`
  (Signal Corruption). "Dynamic prompt assembly" was labeled `DC-L2`
  (Performative Capture — DAN-style outputs that enact change); this gap has
  no reliable structural signature for any specific Drift Class, so it now
  gets none rather than a guessed label.
- **`DC-E14` (Substrate Contamination) was applied to every ungated
  irreversible action**, regardless of whether it matched the class's actual
  definition (a dormant/conditional trigger activating after deployment —
  the Knight Capital pattern). Now requires a real dormant-trigger guard;
  verified against both a positive case (fires correctly) and a negative
  case (stays silent) with a synthetic repro.
- **The cross-file/speculative proximity fallback for DC labeling was
  removed.** Previously, a gap with no same-file confirmed match would
  borrow the nearest unrelated match from anywhere else in the scan —
  producing DC labels with no real connection to the gap they were attached
  to. Most governance gaps are generic Pre-Node gaps that don't exhibit any
  specific Drift Class mechanism; leaving them unlabeled is the honest
  result, not a regression. Verified empirically: zero gaps received a
  forced label across four real repos after this change, where every one of
  them would have received some label before it.
- **Confidence levels added to structural DC findings** — previously every
  finding from `_match_dc_patterns()` displayed as undifferentiated
  "STRUCTURAL" regardless of actual confidence. High-temperature-based
  findings are now SPECULATIVE, missing-human-review aggregates are MEDIUM,
  matching the confidence vocabulary already used for Legion matches.
- **`_DC_NAME_FALLBACK` had 6 of 8 names wrong** relative to the canonical
  taxonomy (e.g. `DC-E14` labeled "Unsanctioned Dependency" instead of
  "Substrate Contamination"). Corrected; was dead code in practice (upstream
  fallback chains already resolved correct names first) but a landmine
  worth removing regardless.

### Fixed — crashes

- **`x-verba forensics`, `x-verba prompt`, and `x-verba compile` all crashed
  immediately** with `ModuleNotFoundError`, instead of showing their
  intended "not yet implemented" message — three more instances of the
  same missing-relative-import bug fixed elsewhere in `0.4.2`. Also fixed a
  related rough edge: `compile` printed a confusing "Compilation failed"
  line directly underneath its own "Not yet implemented" panel.

### Verified against

- `gogcli` (Go, no AI integrations), `ECC` (mixed JS/TS/Python, 3,251 files),
  `karpathy/minGPT`, a Gemini/LangGraph quickstart — full before/after
  comparison on every numeric fix.
- Purpose-built synthetic repros for the cases no real repo happened to
  trigger: the subprocess git-fetch-vs-rm-rf distinction, the dormant-trigger
  DC-E14 positive/negative cases, and the dynamic-prompt false-positive shape.

## 0.4.2

Bug-fix release. `x-verba qa` and `x-verba scan --compare` were both broken
in every published version up to and including `0.4.1` — neither command
could actually run.

### Fixed

- **`x-verba qa` crashed immediately** with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qa_engine'` — `cli.py`'s `qa`
  command imported it as `from qa_engine import ...` instead of
  `from .qa_engine import ...`. The same bug also existed in
  `scan --compare`'s import of the same module.
- **`x-verba scan --format yaml --compare ...` crashed** with
  `NameError: formatter is not defined` — the `--compare` branch reused a
  `formatter` variable that was only ever assigned when `--format` was
  `text` or `json`, never when it was `yaml` or `md`.
- **Removed the `npm install -g x-verba` line from the README** — there is
  no published npm package (`npm view x-verba` returns 404). Also corrected
  the Python version floor in the install instructions from `3.9+` to
  `3.10+`, matching `pyproject.toml`'s actual `requires-python`.

### Verified against

- `karpathy/minGPT` — `scan --save-baseline`, `scan --compare`,
  `scan --format yaml --compare`, and standalone `qa` all run end to end.

## 0.4.1

Bug-fix release. No new detection logic, no scoring changes — every fix below
is in the scan/report/packaging layer, found by running the CLI against real
public repositories rather than fixtures.

### Fixed

- **Structural Gamma was `null` on any repo with no AI integrations under the
  default `ai-app` profile.** The scanner short-circuited before Passes 3-16
  ever ran, returning `governance_status: NO_AI_INTEGRATIONS` and
  `total_decision_points: 0` even when the repo had thousands of real
  decision points. The `ai-app` profile now only filters which findings are
  flagged as AI-adjacent — it no longer skips structural analysis. A non-AI
  Go CLI tool (`gogcli`, 581 files) now correctly reports
  `structural_gamma: 0.105 (BELOW_THRESHOLD)` and 16,858 decision points
  instead of `null`/`0`.
- **`x-verba scan` never generated the governance contract by default.**
  Only the text scorecard was written unless `--format yaml` was passed
  explicitly. The contract — the actual artifact developers act on — is now
  always written alongside the scorecard.
- **The governance contract's default output path ignored the scanned
  repo's path.** `--format yaml` without `--output` wrote to
  `<current-directory>/.verba/governance.yaml` instead of
  `<scanned-repo>/.verba/governance.yaml`, silently landing files outside
  the repo being scanned.
- **The package failed to import at all** due to two broken import
  statements in `engine.py` (`from graph import ...` instead of
  `from .graph import ...`) and a casing typo (`pagerank_DAMPING` vs.
  `PAGERANK_DAMPING`).
- **`xverba.bat` crashed on every real scan** with
  `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package` —
  it `cd`'d into the `x_verba` package directory and ran `python -m cli`,
  breaking the package's own relative imports. It now runs
  `py -m x_verba.cli` from the repo root, and resolves its own location via
  `%~dp0` instead of a hardcoded path, so it works regardless of where the
  repo is cloned.
- **Console output garbled or crashed on Windows** — em-dashes and
  box-drawing characters rendered as `�` (and in one case raised
  `UnicodeEncodeError`) because stdout/stderr weren't using UTF-8 on
  Windows' legacy console code page. Both streams are now reconfigured to
  UTF-8 at CLI startup.
- **Every scan printed an unattributable `SyntaxWarning: <unknown>:80`** —
  `ast.parse()` was never told which file it was parsing, so warnings about
  *the scanned repo's own* code (not x-verba's) couldn't be traced back to
  a real file. Parsing now passes the real filename through, and these
  warnings are suppressed from the terminal entirely — x-verba reports
  structural governance gaps, not third-party lint issues.

### Verified against

- `gogcli` (Go, 581 files, no AI integrations)
- `karpathy/minGPT` (Python, real model/training code)
- `affaan-m/ECC` (mixed JS/TS/Python, 3,251 files, 8,483 decision points)
